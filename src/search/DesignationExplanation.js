The features contributing to the distinctive characteristics of the corridorâ€™s intrinsic quality are recognized throughout the region and are considered regionally significant.</p><br></br>
                <p>To be designated as an All-American Road, a byway must meet criteria for at least two intrinsic qualities that are nationally significant and have one-of-a-kind features that do not exist elsewhere. The road or highway must also be considered a "destination unto itself." That is, the road must provide an exceptional traveling experience so recognized by travelers that they would make a drive along the highway a primary reason for their trip.</p>
