First used by the Chilkat Indians, the highway became a packhorse trail to the Klondike goldfields in the late 1880s. In 1943, the U.S. Army used the highway as a military access road during World War II. The story of the Haines Highway is how the highway is submerged in the natural and cultural settings of the true home of the Bald Eagle. The most significant natural resource along the Haines Highway is the Chilkat River and the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve. The byway runs through the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve along the Chilkat River and through the prime eagle roosting and feeding grounds. This Preserve and its ecosystem are of national and world significance due to hosting the largest congregation of bald eagles in one location. The Chilkat River has the last salmon run in Southeast Alaska and during the months from October to February, more than 3,500 bald eagles will congregate within this 48,000-acre preserve to feed on the late spawning salmon. The eagles fly from more than 100 miles, as far away as the Yukon, to gather at the preserve. The Chilkat River is a very unique body of water within the State of Alaska. Most rivers in Southeast Alaska fall from very high mountain elevations rapidly down to the sea and have a very short length. While this may be a typical river in other parts of Alaska, the river remains warm and ice-free throughout the year creating a unique environment in the region. The combination of slow, meandering river currents, gravel aquifers, and consistent water temperature provides a most unusual and exceptional situation for spawning fish and their eggs. The Tlingit name Chilkat means ‘winter storage container for salmon.’ All species of Alaskan salmon spawn in the Chilkat River and its tributaries. This offers a massive volume of food for a wide variety of creatures, including the bald eagle, black bear, and brown bear.",river
