The Scenic Byways Database is an app that displays data about the byways recognized by the US Department of Transportation as America's Byways. This includes both National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads. Once a user signs up to create an account, it allows them to view byways by state, or search by a variety of criteria. When viewing the page for an individual byway, information displayed includes length, fees, description, and some of the geographic features to be seen on the byway. 

Also on the individual byway pages, users have the ability to leave a comment about the byway and add it to their collection of favorites. All of a users favorites can be viewed on their profile page. There, the user can share information about themselves, including a bio, their location, and favorite state to travel to. 

An interesting feature of the app is the ability to view byways at random. Perhaps you're not sure what sort of road you're looking to travel, or maybe you'd prefer to browse through byways in no particular order. The functionality to view them at random can be a very fun way to explore different places. 

There are a variety of tests that exist in both the back and front ends, which can be run using npm test.

The primary tools used to create the app were JavaScript, Express version 4.18.2, Postgres, and HTML. 

The app has been deployed at https://scenic-frontend.onrender.com/.
